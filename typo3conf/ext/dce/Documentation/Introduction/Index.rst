Introduction
============


What does it do?
----------------

With this extension, you can easily create new dynamic content elements.

In opposite to native content elements (fluid_styled_content), DCEs are based on FlexForms.
FlexForms allows you to define dynamic content structures, without the need to extend tt_content database table.

.. note::
   tt_content is the database table, which stores all content elements.

.. note::
   FlexForms allows defining dynamic forms, which get stored as XML in tt_content column "pi_flexform".
   This makes it impossible to perform queries on fields defined in your DCE, unless you've enabled
   :ref:`TCA mapping <additional-informations-tca-mapping>`


The Idea Behind DCE
-------------------

**D** ynamic **C** ontent **E** lements (DCE)

The name and basic functionality were inspired by TemplaVoilaâ€˜s FCE (Flexible Content Element) feature.
FCE was one of the last missing major features to replace TemplaVoila entirely.

.. note::
   TemplaVoila was a popular template extension for TYPO3, which used FlexForms for everything.


Content Elements in TYPO3
-------------------------

TYPO3 itself provides a bunch of content elements (CE) with EXT:fluid_styled_content.
You can easily hide unused elements or fields, but it is not that easy to build new content element types (CTypes).

If you want to extend content elements in TYPO3 natively, you need to write an extension and provide the custom TCA
configuration. Also, you need to provide a hook, if you want to define the look-like of your content element in the backend
as well.

Goals of DCE
------------

+ Make it easy to create new custom content elements
+ With as many configurable fields as you want
+ Flexible and comfortable templating for each CE (using Fluid)
+ A lower learning curve for editors (using customized content elements)
+ and for integrators as well, who start with TYPO3 CMS


DCE Features
------------

Fields and tabs
"""""""""""""""

+ Create as many fields as required
+ Separate multiple fields with tabs (better overview)
+ Full TCA support
+ Helpful dropdown in the backend, containing common used TCA snippets
+ Also supports Sections (from TemplaVoila) - but it is **not recommended** to use
+ TCA Mapping feature

Schema loading
""""""""""""""

+ Special handling for ``group``, ``select`` and ``inline`` fields, which relates to different records
+ Converts comma-separated lists of uids to ready to use arrays or objects
+ Uses Extbase models (instead of associated arrays, if the requested table has one configured)
+ Resolves FAL relations (media) automatically

DCE Container
"""""""""""""

+ Creates **virtual container** around several content elements of the same CType
+ Useful for e.g. sliders
+ You can define a maximum of items per container
+ You can interrupt a container manually, in each content element
+ Containers are visually highlighted in page module (backend)

Detail pages
""""""""""""

+ Use different templates for single DCE instances
+ Controlled by configurable ``$_GET`` parameter
+ Fake detail pages, thanks to **slugs** you can configure with **Symfony Expressions**
+ Also the detail page title can get adjusted with an expression
+ When **DCE container** is also enabled, content elements which' detail page is **not** triggered, on current page,
  can get hidden automatically


Easy templating (using Fluid)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

+ All output of DCE (in FE and BE) runs with Fluid Templating Engine
+ Inline Fluid templating support (code mirror editor)
+ Templates can also get exported to files
+ A helpful dropdown provides defined variables (fields), common Fluid view helpers and all DCE view helpers in the backend
+ DCE ViewHelper which allows you to fetch a content element based on DCE in any Fluid template: ``<dce:dce uid="1">{field.title}</dce:dce>``

Simple Backend View
"""""""""""""""""""

+ Just define the fields you want to preview in the backend, by clicking
+ Header and bodytext are separated. The field used for header is also used for the label in e.g. list view
+ Also FAL media can get previewed (in bodytext)
+ Alternatively you can provide a full custom Fluid template for backend preview rendering

More
""""

+ **Control the CType** of your content elements by defining an **identifier**
+ Each DCE can have its **own icon** representation. You can also provide a custom icon.
+ Configure new content element in **New Content Element Wizard** (with description)
+ Display custom tt_content (native) fields in your DCE, using a **palette** displayed above the FlexForm fields
+ Show access, media and categories tab (natively)
+ Frontend cache control
+ **Direct output** option (enabled by default). Bypasses lib.contentElement - significant performance boost
+ TypoScript **User Condition** (to check if current page contains specific DCE)
+ Support for TYPO3's Import/Export extension
+ EXT:container and EXT:gridelements support
+ Deprecation notice free in TYPO3 9.5 LTS!
+ Complete documentation existing
