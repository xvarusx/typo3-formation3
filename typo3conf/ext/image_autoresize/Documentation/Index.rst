   :Description:
      Simplify the way your editors may upload their images: no complex local procedure needed, let TYPO3
      automatically resize down their huge images/pictures on-the-fly during upload (or using a scheduler task for
      batch processing) and according to your own business rules (directory/groups). This will highly reduce the
      footprint on your server and speed-up response time if lots of images are rendered (e.g., in a gallery).
      Features an EXIF/IPTC extractor to ensure metadata may be used by the FAL indexer even if not preserved upon
      resizing.
