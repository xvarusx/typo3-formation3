How to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension is using the same contribution workflow as for TYPO3 Core, but with GitHub PRs for the review
process. Please read more about the workflow in the
`TYPO3 Contribution Guide <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-contributionworkflow/master/en-us/>`__.
