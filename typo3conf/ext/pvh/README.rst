TYPO3 Extension PVH (Pizpalue View Helpers)
=============================================

The aim from this extension is to provide general purpose view helpers for the
extension `pizpalue <https://github.com/buepro/typo3-pizpalue>`__. It contains
copies from the great `vhs extensions by Claus Due
<https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/vhs>`__. Many thanks here to Clause for his
excellent extension.

Why copy code? To offer stable releases earlier. Stable releases from VHS
used to be available a view month after a TYPO3-LTS-release. This extension
is going to have stable releases available together with pizpalue.

Code quality
